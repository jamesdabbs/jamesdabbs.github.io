  <p>I work at <a href="http://procore.com">Procore</a>, in the platform group. It's pretty great.</p>

  <p>In my spare time, I contribute to the <a href="https://topology.pi-base.org/">Ï€-Base</a>, <a href="http://jdabbs.com/turn-down-with-watts/">play the drums</a>, and hang out with my wife.</p>

  <p>I'm passionate about learning and teaching. If you're a beginner, a student, or just have a question, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:jamesdabbs@gmail.com">reach out</a>.</p>
