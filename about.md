I teach [Ruby at The Iron Yard in DC](http://theironyard.com/locations/washington-dc/).

In my spare time, I hack on [my topology database](http://topology.jdabbs.com/), contribute to [the Peace Corps](https://github.com/PeaceCorps/medlink), [play the drums](http://jdabbs.com/turn-down-with-watts/), and talk about stuff like:

## Webdev in Haskell @ Polyglot DC

This talk was not recorded, unfortunately, but [slides](https://s3.amazonaws.com/jdabbs.com/hello-yesod.pdf) and a [demo project](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/hello-yesod) are available.

## Graphs: a Drunkard's Walk

An intermediate Ruby Group talk on graphs and graph databases. Accompanied by [this Rails project](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/air-graphs), but note that shortly after this talk, a [neo4j 3.0](https://github.com/neo4jrb/neo4j) was released and is probably the preferred tool to use moving forward.

## Search: Postgres and Elastic

A fireside chat with [Kylie Stradley](https://twitter.com/kyfast) on the use and relative merits of Postgres and ElasticSearch for full-text searching.

## Using Background Workers

An Intermediate Ruby Group talk on background workers, with accompanying blog in [two](http://jdabbs.com/working-smarter/) [parts](http://jdabbs.com/working-smarter-pt-ii/) and [source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/air/releases/tag/cats) (later [updated](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/dcrug-workers) for Rails 4.2 and a talk at [DCRUG](http://www.meetup.com/dcruby/)).

## Categories for the Working Programmer

They say every functional programmer has to write a monad tutorial. I am no exception. This is a talk from the [Atlanta Ruby Group](http://www.atlrug.com/) where I try to sell a room full of Rubyists on category theory.

I have [source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/rb-monads) and [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jdabbs/monads-at-atlrug) from this talk, along with [Clojure source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/clj-monads) for a similar talk that I gave at the [Atlanta Clojure meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Atl-Clj/).

## An Intro to FFI

__Video not available__

A brief introduction to Ruby's [ffi gem](https://github.com/ffi/ffi), with [an example project](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/steffi) using it to wrap [the igraph library](http://igraph.org/redirect.html).
