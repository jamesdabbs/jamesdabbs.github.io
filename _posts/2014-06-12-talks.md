#### [Working Smarter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzpOw8u6OV8)


An Intermediate Ruby Group talk on background workers, with accompanying blog in [two](http://jdabbs.com/working-smarter/) [parts](http://jdabbs.com/working-smarter-pt-ii/) and [source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/air/releases/tag/cats).

#### [Categories for the Working Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pms3h4M8kbs)

They say every functional programmer has to write a monad tutorial. I am no exception. This is a talk from the [Atlanta Ruby Group](http://www.atlrug.com/) where I try to sell a room full of Rubyists on category theory.

I have [source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/rb-monads) and [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/jdabbs/monads-at-atlrug) from this talk, along with [Clojure source code](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/clj-monads) for a similar talk that I gave at the [Atlanta Clojure meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Atl-Clj/).

#### Intro to FFI

A brief introduction to Ruby's [ffi](https://github.com/ffi/ffi) gem, with [an example project](https://github.com/jamesdabbs/steffi) using it to wrap the [igraph library](http://igraph.org/redirect.html). Unfortunately, I think this was the last ATLRUG talk not to be recorded, so no video available here.
