![With Rachel](/assets/images/with-rachel.jpg)

I work at [Procore](https://procore.com), in the platform group. It's pretty great.

In my spare time, I contribute to the [Ï€-Base](https://topology.pi-base.org/), [play the drums](http://jdabbs.com/turn-down-with-watts/), and hang out with my wife.

I'm passionate about learning and teaching. If you're a beginner, a student, or just have a question, please don't hesitate to [reach out](mailto:jamesdabbs@gmail.com).
